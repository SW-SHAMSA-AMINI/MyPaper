5W+1Hpattern:Aperspectiveofsystematicmappingstudiesandacasestudyoncloudsoftwaretesting


A common type of study used by researchers to map out the landscape of a research topic is known as mapping study.Such a study typically begins with an exploratory search on the possible ideas of the research topic, which is of tendoneinanun systematic manner.Hence,the activity of formulating research questions in mapping studiesis illdefined, rendering it difficult for researchers who are new to the topic.There is an eedtoguidethemkickingoffamappingstudyofanunfamiliardomain.Thispaperproposesa5W+1Hpatterntohelpinvestigatorssystematicallyexamineagenericsetofdimensionsinamappingstudytowardtheformulationofresearchquestionsbeforeidentifying,reading,andanalyzingsufficientarticlesofthetopic.Wehavevalidatedthefeasibilityofourproposalbyconductingacasestudyofamappingstudyoncloudsoftwaretesting,thatis,softwaretestingforandoncloudcomputingplatforms.Thecasestudyrevealsthatthe5W+1Hpatterncanleadinvestigatorstodefineasetofsystematic,generic,andcomplementaryresearchquestions,enablingthemtokickoffandexpeditethemappingstudyprocessinawell-definedmanner.Wealsoshareourexperiencesandlessonslearnedfromourcasestudyontheuseofthe5W+1Hpatterninmappingstudies.
